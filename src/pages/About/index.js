              Hi, I'm Joel.

              I am a Full Stack Web Developer who graduated from the Columbia
              Engineering Coding Bootcamp. I recently worked as an Associate
              Front-end engineer for Refersion, an enterprise-level (14,000
              users) Affiliate Marketing Management application.
              <br />
              <br />I was integral part of creating an in-house reusable
              component Library using React Storybook. These components were
              utilized in a redesign of the entire application to showcase more
              robust and responsive data-tables and dashboards. I gained
              experience using the frameworks React and Laravel with Javascript
              and PHP to write, update and deploy code to production. I worked
              in a Agile (Scrum) environment with a team that consistently
              exceeded sprint goals.

              Previously, I worked as Operations Specialist for Uber where my
              work was vital in helping to increase the availability of
              Wheelchair accessible commercial vehicles in NYC. During 2020 I
              was a Logistics Manager for The Migrant Kitchen and built a
              dynamic logistical strategy to deliver 1,000 meals a day, six days
              a week to NYC residents across all 5 burroughs.
