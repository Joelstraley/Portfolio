              Hey, I'm Joel.

              <div className="new-line"></div>
              I'm a Fullstack Web Developer with 1.5 years of professional
              experience using the frameworks React and Laravel with Javascript
              and PHP to write, update and deploy code to production.
              <div className="new-line"></div>
              <br />
              My previous role was at Refersion, an enterprise-level (60k+
              users) Affiliate Marketing Management app, developing and
              maintaining a reusable and responsive component library to create
              scalable single page applications. I've worked in an Agile (Scrum)
              environment with a high-performing team that consistently exceeded
              sprint goals, often completing projects before deadlines and under
              budget.
              <div className="new-line"></div>
              <br />
              Before learning to code, my experience has been in operational
              logistics in fast-paced environments. I worked as an Operations
              Specialist for Uber for 6+ years and spent the 2020 pandemic
              working with The Migrant Kitchen to build a dynamic logistics
              strategy to deliver 1,000 meals a day, six days a week to NYC
              residents across all 5 boroughs.
              <div className="new-line"></div>
              <br />
              Outside of work, I've been involved in Improv and Sketch comedy
              for 10+ years in NYC and enjoy making short films.
